# FUTURE_DS_03
This is a python and ML project aimed at creating a prediction model for loan Approval. It outlines several processes including data cleaning, descriptive analysis, splitting of the dataset to training and testing datasets. As a result of training the model alongside data labels we end up with a prediction model validated using the test dataset.
